# drgn depends heavily on elfutils. In particular, we need a recent version,
# potentially with some patches that may not be released or even merged yet. We
# can't depend on the distribution's elfutils package, so instead we include
# our own.
#
# This script imports elfutils from another repository as a subtree. This is
# similar to git-subtree(1), except that we always replace the subtree instead
# of merging it. The upstream commit and additional commit subjects are
# recorded in the commit message. The additional patches are saved in
# elfutils/PATCHES for posterity.
#
# Note that we should strive not to have a hard fork of elfutils; everything in
# here should be on its way upstream, and the patches should be rebased/pruned
# frequently.
